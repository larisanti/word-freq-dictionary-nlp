# Word Frequency Dictionary for Sentiment Analysis

This repository is a record of a practice lab work from the "Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces" course. My core objective was to understand how individual words contribute to the overall sentiment of a tweet (positive or negative) by tracking their occurrences.

I applied the following NLP techniques:
* Data Loading & Exploration: Initial checks on tweet dataset volume and distribution, ensuring a balanced approach.
* Text Preprocessing: Cleaning raw tweet data by removing Twitter-specific elements (hyperlinks, RT, hashtags), tokenizing, lowercasing, filtering stopwords and punctuation (retaining emoticons), and applying stemming.
* Word Frequency Dictionary: Construction of a custom Python dictionary to map words to their counts within positive and negative tweet categories.
* Data Visualization: Displaying word counts in a clear, formatted table and a scatter plot to visually separate words by sentiment prevalence.
